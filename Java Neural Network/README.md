This is a neural network coded from scratch in java. It's goal was to predict confidence levels for player to win a game of AikidoBigDojo.tbm on any given frame in Toribash (www.toribash.com).

This was a first ever attempt at coding a neural network done with no previous machine learning experience during or after my sophmore year of college. The model was trained on roughly 10,000 ABD replay files.

Model wasn't completely successful though did reach a local minima. Predicted player 2 to have a 55% win chance every time regardless of circumstances. Upon looking more into dataset it was discovered that player 2 won in 55% of the replay folders.

So while not a perfect model by any means this was a very good learning experience and the network was able to successfully reach a local minima.
